# Rocket.Chat to Tuwunel Migration Script

Script to migrate users, channels and messages from Rocket.Chat to a Tuwunel Matrix homeserver.

This project is a fork of `verdigado/rocketchat2matrix`, adapted specifically for Tuwunel.

It currently has beta quality and comes with no warranty.

## Installation and Usage

This setup is intended for a one-time migration from Rocket.Chat to Tuwunel using MongoDB exports and preferably a fresh Tuwunel instance.

The documented setup uses the official Tuwunel Debian package with systemd and RocksDB. Docker is not required.

### Requirements

- Debian or another compatible `apt`-based distribution
- Node.js >= 19
- npm
- git
- curl
- jq
- openssl
- MongoDB database access to the Rocket.Chat server

### Installing Tuwunel

Install the required tools:

```shell
apt update
apt install -y curl ca-certificates git jq openssl
```

Add the official Tuwunel repository:

```shell
curl -fsSL \
  -o /usr/share/keyrings/tuwunel-archive-keyring.gpg \
  https://apt.f.dog/tuwunel-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/tuwunel.sources` with:

```text
Types: deb
URIs: https://apt.f.dog
Suites: stable
Components: main
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/tuwunel-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Install Tuwunel:

```shell
apt update
apt install -y tuwunel
systemctl stop tuwunel
```

Do not start Tuwunel before choosing the final `server_name`.

### Installing the Migration Script

Clone the repository:

```shell
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/9stannn/rocketchat2tuwunel.git
cd rocketchat2tuwunel
```

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```shell
npm ci
```

### Configuring Tuwunel

Edit:

```text
/etc/tuwunel/tuwunel.toml
```

A minimal configuration for a local migration server is:

```toml
[global]

server_name = "my.matrix.host"

database_path = "/var/lib/tuwunel"

address = ["127.0.0.1"]
port = 6167

allow_registration = false
allow_federation = false

registration_shared_secret_file = "/etc/tuwunel/.reg_shared_secret"

appservice_dir = "/etc/tuwunel/appservices"
```

Choose `server_name` carefully before the first start. It becomes part of all Matrix user IDs and should not be changed afterwards.

Generate the registration shared secret:

```shell
openssl rand -hex 32 > /etc/tuwunel/.reg_shared_secret
chown root:tuwunel /etc/tuwunel/.reg_shared_secret
chmod 640 /etc/tuwunel/.reg_shared_secret
```

Create the Application Service directory:

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/tuwunel/appservices
chown root:tuwunel /etc/tuwunel/appservices
chmod 750 /etc/tuwunel/appservices
```

Enable the service without starting it yet:

```shell
systemctl enable tuwunel
```

### Configuring the Application Service

Copy the example included in the repository:

```shell
cp app-service.example.yaml \
  /etc/tuwunel/appservices/rocketchat2tuwunel.yaml
```

Edit:

```text
/etc/tuwunel/appservices/rocketchat2tuwunel.yaml
```

The configuration should look like:

```yaml
id: 'rc2tuwunel migration'
url: null

as_token: 'CHANGE_ME_AS_TOKEN'
hs_token: 'CHANGE_ME_HS_TOKEN'

sender_localpart: '_rc_migration_bot'

namespaces:
  users:
    - exclusive: false
      regex: '@.*'
```

Generate two different random values:

```shell
openssl rand -hex 32
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Use one value for `as_token` and another value for `hs_token`.

The `as_token` value must also be configured as `AS_TOKEN` in `.env`.

Set the permissions:

```shell
chown root:tuwunel \
  /etc/tuwunel/appservices/rocketchat2tuwunel.yaml

chmod 640 \
  /etc/tuwunel/appservices/rocketchat2tuwunel.yaml
```

### Configuring the Migration Environment

Copy the example:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` manually:

```env
HOMESERVER_URL='http://127.0.0.1:6167'
REGISTRATION_SHARED_SECRET='change-me'
AS_TOKEN='change-me'
EXCLUDED_USERS='rocket.cat'
ADMIN_USERNAME='admin'
ADMIN_PASSWORD='verySecretPassword'
```

`REGISTRATION_SHARED_SECRET` must contain the same value stored in:

```text
/etc/tuwunel/.reg_shared_secret
```

`AS_TOKEN` must contain the same value as `as_token` in:

```text
/etc/tuwunel/appservices/rocketchat2tuwunel.yaml
```

Use a strong password for `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### Exporting Rocket.Chat Data

Export the required MongoDB collections on the Rocket.Chat server:

```shell
mongoexport \
  --collection=rocketchat_message \
  --db=rocketchat \
  --out=rocketchat_message.json

mongoexport \
  --collection=rocketchat_room \
  --db=rocketchat \
  --out=rocketchat_room.json

mongoexport \
  --collection=users \
  --db=rocketchat \
  --out=users.json
```

If the Rocket.Chat MongoDB instance requires authentication, a replica set or a custom connection string, use `mongoexport --uri=...` instead.

Copy the three files into:

```text
inputs/
```

The directory must contain:

```text
inputs/
├── rocketchat_message.json
├── rocketchat_room.json
└── users.json
```

### Preparing a Fresh Tuwunel Instance

The repository includes `reset.sh` for preparing a fresh migration environment.

Run it from the repository directory:

```shell
sudo ./reset.sh
```

The script:

- stops the Tuwunel systemd service
- deletes the current RocksDB data in `/var/lib/tuwunel`
- removes the local migration database
- removes the previous migration admin access token
- starts Tuwunel
- waits for the homeserver to become available
- creates the configured Matrix migration administrator
- saves its access token to `src/config/tuwunel_access_token.json`
- removes old migration log files

> **Warning**
>
> `reset.sh` deletes the complete Tuwunel database stored in `/var/lib/tuwunel`.
> Only use it for a fresh installation, a test environment, or when you intentionally want to restart the migration from zero.
> Do not run it on a Tuwunel server containing data that must be kept.

After the script completes, Tuwunel is running through systemd and the migration admin token is ready.

### Running the Migration

Run:

```shell
npm start
```

The migration processes users, rooms and messages and then applies direct chats, pinned messages and final room memberships.

The migration can be restarted if it is interrupted. Existing mappings are stored in the local SQLite database so already migrated objects are not blindly recreated.

A completed migration ends with:

```text
info: Done.
```

### Migrated User Passwords

Rocket.Chat passwords cannot be migrated.

Tuwunel requires a non-empty password when creating a user, so the migration generates a random password for every migrated Rocket.Chat user.

After migration, users therefore need a Matrix password reset or an external authentication method such as SSO.

The migration administrator keeps the password configured with `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```shell
npm test
```

You can also verify that Tuwunel is responding locally:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:6167/_matrix/client/versions
```

For normal client access, configure an appropriate reverse proxy and TLS setup for your Matrix deployment.

### Cleaning Up After Migration

Before putting the migrated homeserver into production, remove migration-only credentials that are no longer required.

This can include:

- the registration shared secret
- the Application Service registration if the migration is completely finished
- `src/config/tuwunel_access_token.json`
- `.env`
- migration logs
- Rocket.Chat export files containing user or message data

Restart Tuwunel after removing or changing its Application Service configuration.

## Design Decisions

- Rocket.Chat data is imported from manual MongoDB exports.
- Rocket.Chat rooms are converted to Matrix rooms.
- Read-only channel attributes are not translated into Matrix power levels.
- Reaction and emoji mappings are handled by `src/emojis.json`.
- Discussions are not currently converted to Matrix threads.
- Historical state-change events are generally not recreated; the final room state is preferred instead.
- Membership changes are applied when required and finalized at the end of the migration.
- Historical room-name changes are not recreated when the previous state cannot be determined.
- Threads whose root message is missing or belongs to a deleted user may be skipped.
- The migration is designed so it can continue after an interruption by using its local mappings.
- A regular Rocket.Chat username that conflicts with the configured migration administrator can cause problems.
